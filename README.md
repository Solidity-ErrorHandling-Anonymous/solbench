To examine the evolution of error handling in the context of Solidity we have developed SOLBENCH. Through SOLBENCH we are able to collect real-world contracts incrementally and analyse them in a well-defined manner.

To run this Contract Visitor, use the following command:
```
$ python3 contract_visitor.py
```
$ python3 controct_visitor.py

To run the HeuristiRules run the command:
```
$ python3 HR.py
```
